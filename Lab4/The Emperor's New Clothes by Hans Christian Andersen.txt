1) Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he
spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did
he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him
for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any
other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of
him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the
court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out
that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the
clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to
everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
8) The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at
his own expense.
And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the
loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two
honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon
as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever;
although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.
